I'm trying to gain root access to a Zyxel NR7101 router. I have serial access and can see the bootlog, but I'm unable to interrupt the boot process to get to the U-Boot prompt. I've tried pressing ESC, Ctrl+C, and other common keys. I also have the supervisor password, but it doesn't work on the serial console, and I can't access the web GUI.

I'm looking for specific methods to:

Interrupt the boot process on the Zyxel NR7101 to get to the U-Boot or Z-Loader prompt.
Find the correct IP address for the web GUI, or force the device into a state where the web GUI is accessible.
Any known vulnerabilities or alternative methods for gaining a root shell on the Zyxel NR7101.
I have the following information:

Device: Zyxel NR7101
Serial Console Output: (You can paste the bootlog here)
Supervisor Password: (You can mention that you have it, but you don't need to share the actual password)
Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.
